# GitHub-WBDAssignmentv1.2
Web Based Database Version 1.2 [FdSc in Computing 2nd Year]

This site is the final code I will be submitting as part of my Web Based Database module.  I am currently learning PHP an MySQLi, subsequently there maybe flaws in my code, and I have no doubt there will be better ways in which to do some of the things I am trying to achieve in this assignment, so please excuse a novice's mistakes.

For anyone that may come across this code, by all means please comment on it, but please can you not amend any of the code as the work I hand in has to be my own.

Regards

Darren
